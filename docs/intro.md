# Aus2200

Aus2200 is an ACCESS regional atmospheric run over the entire Australian continent, with a grid spacing of 0.0198 degree (approximately 2.2km at the equator)

It is intended as an extension of the very high resolution Aus400 run, compared to the previous run Aus2200 uses a lower resolution but is run for a much longer simulation period.


## Configuration

Aus2200 uses the Unified Model atmosphere and JULES land surface. It is based off of the [UM Nested Suite](https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/rmed/wiki/suites/nesting) using [RAL3](https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/rmed/wiki/ra3) science configuration.
